# Jasmine 2.0 Goals

1. No globals!
  * jasmine library is entirely inside `jasmine` namespace
  * globals required for backwards compatibility should be added in `boot.js` (EG, var describe = jasmine.getCurrentEnv().describe lives in boot.js)
1. Don't use properties as getters. Use methods.
  * Properties aren't encapsulated -- can be mutated, unsafe.
  * easier to refactor as needed
